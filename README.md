# google-playstore-review-extractor
This is a mini tool which will extract all the reviews from google play store. Then we save that data to multiple .json files. Then after the process is done we will append all the files in one single file. Then this combined .json file will be converted to Excel file. Then we upload the file to google sheets, where we can perform multiple analytical operations. 


Use this online tool to convert .json files into .xls or .csv files.
